##COLLABORATIVE INTERNET  
###A Rough Summary  
  
Build the Collaborative Internet started as an informal meetup group in February 2013.  Founded by Matthew Schutte after he had stumbled upon several brilliant thinkers that were pursuing work that coincided with his vision of where the world, and the web, should be headed.  

The founding was inspired, most notably by conversations with:  
Harlan Wood  
Jack Senechal  
Carter Thaxton  
Phil Schatz  
and Scott Albritton  

As Jack summarized after one of our meetings in March 2013:
  
  
    
We aspire to enable a broad ecosystem of applications that operate across boundaries of data type and locale. These applications will likely be cloud based and draw from our personal clouds as well as data sources all across the internet.  
  
In order to accomplish this we need to build certain infrastructure-level tools and protocols that will support the development of distributed applications, such as trust networks, fork-based collaboration, and annotation. We also need to provide users with streamlined ways to navigate the myriad data pathways that become available to them.  
  
Core principles of the distributed cloud ecosystem  
--------------------------------------------------   
- Massively distributed data & functionality  
- Unix design principles - atomic units of functionality  
- Data interoperability  
- Forking  
- Versioning  
- Unfettered duplication  
- Content addressability  
- Replaying agent actions / pathways  
- Spheres of data - be as open or closed as you want to be  
- Community self-regulation & curation  
- Eventual consistency  
  
Things we need to build  
-----------------------   
- Forking / collaboration  
- Visualization / navigation  
- Trust networks & other filters  
- Underlying data graph (the matrix...)  
- Annotation  
  
  
  
  
Since that discussion, new insights have emerged, including clarity on how privacy and transparency can be balanced, not by formal policies, but by decentralized enforcement of informal norms.  Other insights have included security management based on capabilities as well as general outlines for the structure of a distributed network of graphs and indexes with publication and subscription under the control of each individual user.  

Don't know what all of that means?  
That's OK.  Neither did we.  
We're figuring this stuff out as we go along.
  
Please join in on the conversation.   
Attend an upcoming Digital Unconference and help us find our way forward.  

Thanks,
