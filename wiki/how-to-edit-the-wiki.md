## How To Edit This Wiki

This wiki is hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) and uses [Prose](http://prose.io) as a simple editor. GitHub Pages publishes [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to HTML using the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) engine. This gives us a light-weight wiki application, with all of the collaborative editing features of Git and GitHub.
