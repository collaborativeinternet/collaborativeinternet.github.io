##HISTORY

Build the Collaborative Internet started as an informal meetup group in February 2013.   
  
Founded by Matthew Schutte after he had stumbled upon several brilliant thinkers that were pursuing work that coincided with his vision of where the world, and the web, should be headed.  

The founding was inspired, most notably by conversations with:  
Harlan Wood  
Jack Senechal  
Carter Thaxton  
Phil Schatz  
and Scott Albritton  

In July of 2013, the members of the group decided to move the conversation, and the development work, online.  This move into the digital realm is enabling broader participation as well as better recording, sharing and curation of our work.

This wiki is used primarily as a coordination tool for our Digital Unconferences and a repository for the work that gets done during those events.
